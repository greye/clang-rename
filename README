Source code has been ripped off original Clang source tree for personal use
as standalone tool.

This fork implements custom compilation database to allow headers as tool
target propagating replacements to all dependent translation units.

Dependencies:
    premake 4.4+ (CMake scripts has been imported directly, doesn't work atm)
    Clang 3.5

Requires custom compile_filedeps.json database that is (non)convenient JSON
compilation database with additional sequence per entry storing translation
unit dependencies, e.g. headers. Assuming gcc-like compiler (for -MM
option) one can generate such a database from compile_commands.json using
script like support/db2deps.sh (requires GNU sed). compile_commands.json
can be generated using CMake (if used as a build system), tools like
BEAR[1] or be faked using custom scripts (see support/jsondb.sh).

Sample Vim function is in support/rename.vim.
