Source code has been ripped off original Clang source tree for personal use
as standalone tool.

Dependencies:
    premake 4.4+ (CMake scripts has been imported directly, doesn't work atm)
    Clang 3.5+

Requires compile_commands.json database to work (support/jsondb.sh for fake
manual generation or use something like BEAR[1]). Takes byte offset into
file and updates given symbol with -new-name. Sample Vim function is in
support/rename.vim.
